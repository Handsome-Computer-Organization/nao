/**
 * \class MultiKalmanModel
 * 
 * This class stores a set of multiple \c KalmanPositionHypotheses. Each
 * hypothesis represents position and velocity of an object (e.g. ball, obstacle)
 * filtered by a Kalman filter.
 * The hypotheses also have a validity which can be used to select the best one
 * as final model. Thus the \c MultiKalmanModel can deal with jumping percepts 
 * by selecting the most valid percepts via the best hypothesis.
 *
 * Local models stores positions and velocities in relative robot coordinates
 * while remote and team models store them in global field coordinates.
 * \see KalmanPositionHypothesis, RemoteMultiKalmanModel
 *
 * \tparam hypothesis_t The type of each hypothesis of this model.
 *                      It must be derived from \c KalmanPositionHypothesis.
 * \tparam towardsOneModel Defines whether the MultiKalmanModel converges to
 *                       a single model (e.g. ball) not (e.g. robot map)
