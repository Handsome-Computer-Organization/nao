/**
 * \class LiveConfigurationState
 * 
 * Declaration of the LiveConfigurationState representation.
 * 
 * In order to provide easier testing on the field the robots should be configurable without the
 * use of the simulator and the need to of a redeploy after configuration changes. Since 
 * multiple settings could be subject to change the LiveConfigurationState centralizes information
 * about which setting is currently being changed. A press of the middle head touch button 
 * changes the configuration state. Other modules can require the LiveConfigurationState in order
 * to react to button presses given that the correct configuration state is active.
 * 
 * Example:
 * A special role provider can be used in tests with a single robot that uses a fixed role and 
 * changes that role on a press of the rear/front head button, but only if the LiveConfigurationState
 * is set to role configuration.
